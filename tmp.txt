Title:
3D Editings using Diffusion Models

Abstract:
In this talk, 
Binglun Wang will present his research works and related work in 3D Radiance Field and Mesh Editing using Diffusion Models and share his insight and conculsion in 3D editing task.

Binglun will firstly present 3D Radiance Field editing related works and his work:  ProteusNeRF, accepted in I3D 2024 with Niloy Mitra at UCL. ProteusNeRF is a fast and lightweight framework for interactive editing of NeRF assets via existing image manipulation tools or generative frameworks. This is enabled by a novel 3D-aware image context that allows linking edits across multiple views. Currently, the 3D-aware image context methods have used in many industrial application related to solve inconsistent issues.

In the second part, he will present how to input an untextured mesh, output a fully textured mesh in related works and his current 3D mesh editing work  Autotexturing++, finished in September 2024 at Adobe Research with Duygu Ceylan.

Speaker Biography:

Binglun Wang is a fully funded 4-year (10/2024-10/2028) PhD student at University College London (UCL) VECG group work with He Wang and Niloy Mitra. Binglun is also a visiting researcher at Adobe Research London work closely with Duygu Ceylan and Niloy Mitra. 

Binglun's research interests: My research interest span Computer Graphics, Machine Learning and Computational Physics, all are important to me in exploring new ways of physically realistic digital creation. Currently, I focus on the research of physics-based character-fluid simulation and 3D/4D editing.
