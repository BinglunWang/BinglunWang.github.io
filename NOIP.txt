NOIP (English: National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces, Chinese: 全国青少年信息学奥林匹克联赛) is an informatics competition organised by the People's Republic of China for secondary school students in China (including Hong Kong and Macau).

NOIP awards prizes on a provincial basis. As of 2019, most of the participants who win the first prize in the improvement category can be qualified for independent university admission.

NOIP is divided into popular and advanced categories according to the target audience, with an introductory category piloted in Shanghai in 2018; it is divided into two stages, the preliminary round and the final round. The preliminary round will examine some basic computer knowledge and algorithm fundamentals, and the final round will be a computer test. The time is usually the second weekend of November, with the Improvement Group I exam on Saturday morning from 8:30-12:00 (3.5 hours, 3 questions) and the General Group from 14:30-18:00 (3.5 hours, 4 questions), and the Improvement Group II exam on Sunday morning from 8:30-12:00 (3.5 hours, 3 questions). The same set of papers is used across the country, but the rules for judging are specified by the CCF (Chinese Computer Society) according to the province and are published on the official NOI website after the competition. The first prize score line varies slightly from province to province.

The NOIP was suspended by the CCF on 16 August 2019 and was announced to be reinstated on 21 January 2020.
