# Welcome
My name is Binglun Wang, I am currently an MSc student in Computer Graphics, Vision & Imaging at University College London. In September 2022, I finished another MSc (Distinction) in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at The University of Birmingham, and before that, I did my undergraduate (Class I) in Electronic Information Science and Technology at the University of Essex as the final year of a joint four-year programme with Northwest University, China. Iâ€™m also a multi-silver medallist in ACM-International Collegiate Programming Contest. 

My research interest in Computer Graphics & Machine Learning. I hope to explore new ways of using AI as a tool to enhance efficiency in the meta-universe space, with a particular interest in moving from images to 3D.
