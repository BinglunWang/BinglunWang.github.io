### Welcome

My name is Binglun Wang, an MSc student in Computer Graphics, Vision & Imaging at University College London, supervised by [Prof. Niloy J. Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/) in thesis, finishing in September 2023. I am expecting a First with top marks in many modules. Also, I am a Research Assistant at [Max Planck UCL Centre](https://www.mps-ucl-centre.mpg.de/), work with [Kinross Prof. Raymond J. Dolan](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mental-health/people/professor-ray-dolan).

<!-- In September 2022, I finished another MSc (Distinction) in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at The University of Birmingham, and before that, I did my undergraduate (Class I) in Electronic Information Science and Technology at The University of Essex as the final year of a joint four-year programme with Northwest University, China. I’m also a multi-silver medallist in ACM-International Collegiate Programming Contest. 
 -->
I hope to explore new ways to improve human efficiency and life in a specific area.
