### Welcome

My name is Binglun Wang, I am currently an MSc student in Computer Graphics, Vision & Imaging at University College London, finishing this September. I am expecting a First with top marks in many modules.

Iâ€™m also a multi-silver medallist in ACM-International Collegiate Programming Contest.
