### RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

* Semantic Segmentation of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) Images using Deep Learning, module project, University of Birmingham [html.](Semantic_Segmentation.html)<br>
2021<br>
  + Implemented segmentation task and improved the performance of 4NNs (UNet, DeepLab, SegNet, FCN) in small dataset (training dataset: 100 grayscale intensity images at 96 × 96 resolution）
  + Results: The best test dice score achieved 0.891 (bagging of UNet3+ and UNet) <br>

* Image Classification in Deep learning, Degree Project, University of Essex [pdf.](Image_Classification.pdf)<br>
2020-2021
Graduate Dissertation / Supervisor: Lu Lin
  + Summarised and investigated several significant modern convolutional neural networks: LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet
  + Analysed the effectiveness of optimisers, data augmentation, dropout layer, and batch normalisation with extensive experiments 
  + Created a GUI system to visually compare results from different CNNs and classify photos in real time with trained models
  + Results: the top1 val. errors (%) in CIFAR10 are 29.39, 16.3, 15.93 and 9.87 respectively (LeNet, AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogLeNet)<br>
