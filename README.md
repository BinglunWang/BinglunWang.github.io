My name is Binglun Wang, I am currently an MSc student in Computer Graphics, Vision & Imaging at University College London. In September 2022, I finished another MSc (Distinction) in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at The University of Birmingham, and before that, I did my undergraduate (Class I) in Electronic Information Science and Technology at The University of Essex as the final year of a joint four-year programme with Northwest University, China. Iâ€™m also a multi-silver medallist in ACM-International Collegiate Programming Contest.
